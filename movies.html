<h1>Here is a list of Movies to Watch</h1>
<p>Over the last few weeks, my family and I have been watching a lot of movies. Here are some of our favorites.</p>

    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Picture</th>
        <th>Description</th>

        <td>Togo would have to be my favorite movie of all the ones we watched recently. The movie was inspired by a true story, the 1925 Serum Run to Nome. There was an outbreak of diptheria in Alaska. The only way to get the serum in time to save the town was to send a team of sled dogs across Alaska. This movie tells the true story of Togo, one of the lead dogs who participated in the race to get the serum.</td>

        </td>
        <td>Onward would probably have to be my second favorite. Onward is about two brothers who use magic to bring back their father so they can spend a day with him. This movie is full of adventure, fantasy, and brotherly love. This movie also made us cry at the end.</td>

        </td>
        <td>Parent Trap is a old time favorite movie about two girls who meet at camp and discover that they are twins. They switch places in order to meet their other parent and experience life on the other side. They work together to get rid of their dad's new girlfriend so they can reunite their family.</td>

        </td>
        <td>My family decided to watch the movie Holes because we have all read the book. Both me and my sister read the book with our mom when we were younger and my youngest sister just finished it. Holes is about a kid named Stanley Yelnats who is sent Camp Green Lake, a camp for boys that focuses on "character building." One thing I really like about this movie is that it has lots of stories that interconnect.</td>

        <td>Escape to Witch Mountain is an older movie that my parents watched when they were kids. The movie is about a brother and sister who have supernatural powers. They get taken by a man who wants to abuse their powers, but they manage to escape. My sisters and I thought that the special effects quality in this movie were hilarious, compared to the quality we have now, but overall it was a great movie.<td>
