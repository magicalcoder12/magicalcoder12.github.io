  <h1 class="h1">Here are some famous verses that are great for memorizing! If you're looking for more of a challenge, consider memorizing a whole chapter instead of a verse. Psalm 23 is a great chapter to memorize if you're up for the challenge.</h1>
  <p>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16</p>
  <p>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Galations 5:22-23</p>
  <p>For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11</p>
  <p>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight. Proverbs 3:5-6</p>
